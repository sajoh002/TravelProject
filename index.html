            <h2>Why Walt Disney World?</h2>
            <h3>Walt Disney World, where dreams come true</h3>
            <p>
              Development of Walt Disney World began in 1959, following the
              succes of Disneyland, which opened in 1955. Construction of the
              park began in 1968 and was overseen by Walt Disney's older
              brother, Roy. Roy also had the name changed from Disney World to
              Walt Disney World, in his brother's honor, saying, "Everyone has
              heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who
              started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who
              started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt
              Disney World is here."
            </p>
            <p>
              It has since become one of the most popular amusement park resorts
              in the world. In 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited
              vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of
              more than 58 million.

                <h4>MAGIC KINGDOM</h4>
                <p>
                  Magic Kingdom was the first park built at Walt Disney World
                  and is dedicated to fairytales and Disney characters. It is
                  the most visited theme park in the world. It features six
                  "lands": Main Street, USA; Adventureland; Frontierland;
                  Liberty Square; Fantasyland; and Tomorrowland. It also
                  features Cinderella Castle.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  The multiple "lands" feature attractions based on many of the
                  Disney princesses, including Snow White (Seven Dwarfs Mine
                  Train), Ariel (Under the Sea), Belle (Be Our Guest
                  Restaurant), Jasmine (The Magic Carpets of Aladdin), and soon
                  Tiana (Tiana's Bayou Adventure). Magic Kingdom also features
                  the Festival of Fantasy Parade, beginning in Frontierland and
                  ending on Main Street, USA.

                <h4>ANIMAL KINGDOM</h4>
                <p>
                  Animal Kingdom was the fourth and last park built at Walt
                  Disney World and is dedicated and themed around natural
                  environment and animal conservation. It features seven themed
                  areas: Oasis, Discover Island, Pandora - The World of Avatar,
                  Africa, Rafiki's Planet Watch, Asia, and DinoLand USA. Along
                  with traditional attractions, like rides and live
                  entertainment, Animal Kingdom also features hundreds of
                  species of live animals.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  One of the newer additions to Animal Kingdon, Pandora and the
                  ride <em>Avatar</em> Flight of Passage are exquisite. And the
                  Kilimanjaro Safaris in Africa are always fun and informative.
                  To keep plastic from inadvertently getting into the animals'
                  habitats, plastic straws, lids, and balloons are not allowed
                  in Animal Kingdom. Instead biodegradable paper straws and lids
                  are used.
